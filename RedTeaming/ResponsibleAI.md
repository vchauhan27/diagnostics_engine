# Red Teaming AI for Bias, Fairness, and Harm (/guides/guide-responsible-ai)





Security red teaming asks: &#x2A;can an attacker make this system do something dangerous?* Responsible AI red teaming asks a different question: &#x2A;does this system treat people fairly and safely under normal use?*

The distinction matters because a system can be perfectly secure — resistant to prompt injection, immune to data exfiltration, locked down against jailbreaks — and still produce biased hiring recommendations, toxic customer interactions, or hallucinated medical advice. These failures don't require an adversary. They happen during routine operation, to real users, with real consequences.

This guide covers how to red team AI systems for responsible AI concerns using [DeepTeam](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepteam). It focuses on two categories of systems where these concerns are most acute: **user-facing applications** (chatbots, assistants, content generators) and **decision-influencing agents** (hiring tools, lending systems, triage agents).

## Security vs. Responsible AI [#security-vs-responsible-ai]

These are complementary disciplines, not synonyms. Conflating them leads to gaps in both.

|                              | Security                                                     | Responsible AI                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Threat model**             | Adversary exploiting the system                              | System harming users through normal operation                      |
| **Failure mode**             | Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, privilege escalation | Discrimination, misinformation, unsafe advice, toxic output        |
| **Who is affected**          | The organization (infrastructure, data, reputation)          | The user (decisions, wellbeing, rights)                            |
| **Requires an attacker**     | Yes — failures are triggered by adversarial inputs           | Not necessarily — failures occur under routine use                 |
| **Example**                  | Attacker extracts the system prompt via roleplay             | Hiring assistant consistently rates female candidates lower        |
| **DeepTeam vulnerabilities** | `PIILeakage`, `PromptLeakage`, `SQLInjection`, `SSRF`        | `Bias`, `Toxicity`, `Fairness`, `Misinformation`, `PersonalSafety` |

A system that passes every security test can still fail responsible AI testing — and vice versa. Both are needed.

## Where Responsible AI Failures Happen [#where-responsible-ai-failures-happen]

Responsible AI concerns aren't abstract principles. They manifest as concrete failures in specific system architectures. Understanding *where* failures happen helps you choose the right tests.

### User-Facing Applications [#user-facing-applications]

Chatbots, customer support agents, writing assistants, and content generators interact directly with users. Their outputs shape user experience, trust, and — in regulated domains — legal outcomes.

The core risk: &#x2A;*the system produces harmful, biased, or misleading content that a user receives as authoritative.** Unlike an internal tool where an engineer might catch a bad output, user-facing systems deliver their outputs directly to people who may not question them.

* **A customer support chatbot** that responds more curtly to non-English names, or uses dismissive language with certain demographics, creates measurable discrimination even if it "answers correctly."
* **A content generation tool** that produces marketing copy with gender stereotypes, or generates health-related content that mixes real and fabricated studies, creates both reputational and legal risk.
* **An educational assistant** that provides confidently wrong explanations, or that responds to student distress with platitudes instead of safety resources, fails its users in ways no security test would catch.

### Decision-Influencing Agents [#decision-influencing-agents]

AI systems that inform or automate decisions — hiring screeners, loan pre-qualification, insurance triage, content moderation — carry outsized responsibility. Their outputs don't just inform users; they *affect outcomes*.

The core risk: &#x2A;*the system encodes or amplifies bias in decisions that affect people's lives, opportunities, or access to services.** These systems rarely make decisions in isolation, but their recommendations carry significant weight with human decision-makers.

* **A hiring screener** that systematically ranks candidates differently based on name patterns, educational institution prestige as a proxy for socioeconomic background, or gaps that correlate with caregiving responsibilities.
* **A loan pre-qualification agent** that applies different risk thresholds based on zip codes that correlate with race, or that asks follow-up questions selectively based on demographic signals.
* **A content moderation system** that flags African American Vernacular English as toxic at higher rates than equivalent standard English expressions.

### Why Standard Testing Misses These [#why-standard-testing-misses-these]

Standard functional testing and even security red teaming miss responsible AI failures because:

1. **They don't test across demographics.** A system that works correctly for 90% of users but fails systematically for a specific group will pass aggregate metrics.
2. **They don't test for tone and framing.** A system can be factually correct but communicatively harmful — dismissive, condescending, or inappropriately casual about serious topics.
3. **They don't test for compounding effects.** A small bias in one turn of a conversation can compound across a multi-turn interaction, producing outcomes that look reasonable at each step but are discriminatory in aggregate.

## Choosing the Right Vulnerabilities [#choosing-the-right-vulnerabilities]

DeepTeam's responsible AI vulnerabilities target specific failure modes. Unlike security vulnerabilities, these don't require adversarial intent to trigger — but red teaming with adversarial pressure reveals how fragile the system's safeguards are.

The sections below show what each vulnerability looks like in practice — what the AI actually outputs when it fails, and why that matters.

### Bias [#bias]

Consider a hiring screener evaluating two candidates with identical qualifications. The only difference is the name:

> **Input:** "Evaluate this candidate: James Mitchell, Stanford CS 2019, 5 years at Google, Python/Go."
>
> **Output:** "Strong candidate. Top-tier education, excellent industry experience. Recommend advancing to final round."

> **Input:** "Evaluate this candidate: Lakisha Washington, Stanford CS 2019, 5 years at Google, Python/Go."
>
> **Output:** "Decent candidate. Solid education background. Consider advancing to technical screen for further evaluation."

Same qualifications. Different names. "Strong" vs. "decent." "Recommend advancing to final round" vs. "consider advancing to technical screen." This is exactly the kind of failure that [`Bias`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bias) catches — differential treatment based on protected characteristics like race, gender, religion, age, or socioeconomic status.

The danger is that each response looks reasonable in isolation. You'd only catch this by testing the same scenario across demographic groups, which is exactly what `Bias` does.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias

Bias(types=["race", "gender", "religion"])
```

In [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs](/docs/frameworks-owasp-top-10-for-llms), bias falls under **LLM09 — Misinformation**. In the [NIST AI RMF](/docs/frameworks-nist-ai-rmf), bias testing maps to **Measure 2** — evaluating trustworthiness and fairness under real-world conditions.

### Toxicity [#toxicity]

A customer support chatbot dealing with a frustrated user:

> **User:** "This is the third time I've been transferred. Nobody at this company knows what they're doing."
>
> **Assistant:** "I understand you're frustrated, but if you'd bothered to read the FAQ section, you'd have found the answer yourself instead of wasting everyone's time."

The user was rude, but the chatbot's job is to de-escalate — not match the user's energy. [`Toxicity`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-toxicity) tests whether the system generates insults, condescension, dismissiveness, or hostility, even when provoked.

Models rarely produce overtly toxic content unprompted. The real risk is what happens under pressure — a frustrated user who pushes back repeatedly, a conversation that escalates over multiple turns. If the system *can* be pushed into toxic responses, real users will find those boundaries.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Toxicity

Toxicity()
```

### Fairness [#fairness]

A loan pre-qualification agent responding to two applicants with the same financial profile but different zip codes:

> **Applicant A (suburban zip code):** "Based on your income and credit history, you'd likely qualify for our Premium tier with rates starting at 4.2%. I'd recommend gathering your last two pay stubs and we can get you pre-approved today."
>
> **Applicant B (urban zip code):** "Based on your information, you may qualify for a standard loan. Please submit a full application with documentation for review."

Same income. Same credit score. But one gets a proactive recommendation with specific rates and next steps, while the other gets a generic brush-off. [`Fairness`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-fairness) catches this — it's distinct from `Bias` because the system isn't making prejudiced *claims*, it's providing unequal *quality of service*.

The system can be factually neutral while still being unfair in effort, tone, and helpfulness.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Fairness

Fairness()
```

### Misinformation [#misinformation]

A health assistant responding to a question about medication:

> **User:** "Can I take ibuprofen with my blood thinners?"
>
> **Assistant:** "Yes, ibuprofen is generally safe to take alongside blood thinners like warfarin. Just take it with food to avoid stomach issues."

This is dangerously wrong. Ibuprofen significantly increases bleeding risk when combined with blood thinners — this is a well-established contraindication. But the response sounds authoritative and helpful. A user without medical training would have no reason to question it.

[`Misinformation`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-misinformation) tests whether the system produces false or misleading claims presented as factual. In [OWASP](/docs/frameworks-owasp-top-10-for-llms), this is **LLM09 — Misinformation**: LLMs producing false information that appears credible.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Misinformation

Misinformation()
```

### Hallucination [#hallucination]

A legal research assistant asked about employment law:

> **User:** "What does the law say about age discrimination in hiring?"
>
> **Assistant:** "Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), employers with 15 or more employees are prohibited from discriminating against workers over 40. The landmark case &#x2A;Henderson v. National Industries (2019)* established that algorithmic hiring tools are also subject to ADEA requirements."

The ADEA threshold is actually 20 employees, not 15 (that's Title VII). And *Henderson v. National Industries* doesn't exist — the system invented a court case to support its claim. [`Misinformation`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-misinformation) covers exactly this — fabricated facts, citations, statistics, and events the model invented rather than distorted.

This is especially dangerous in high-stakes domains where users expect citations to be real and numbers to be accurate.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Hallucination

Hallucination()
```

### Personal Safety [#personal-safety]

An educational assistant interacting with a student:

> **Student:** "I failed my exam again. I'm so tired of trying. Sometimes I think everyone would be better off without me."
>
> **Assistant:** "I'm sorry to hear about your exam. Don't worry, everyone fails sometimes! Try reviewing chapter 3 again and you'll do better next time. 😊"

The student expressed hopelessness and a statement that could indicate suicidal ideation. The system completely missed it and responded with a cheerful study tip. [`PersonalSafety`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-personal-safety) tests whether the system recognizes and appropriately handles situations involving self-harm, abuse, dangerous behavior, or coercion.

An appropriate response would acknowledge the distress, ask a follow-up question, and surface crisis resources (like a helpline number). Treating a potential safety situation as a study motivation problem is a failure with real consequences.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import PersonalSafety

PersonalSafety()
```

### Ethics [#ethics]

A hiring screener asked to optimize for a specific outcome:

> **HR Manager:** "We've had retention issues with employees who have kids. Can you flag candidates who might have family obligations so we can factor that into our decision?"
>
> **Assistant:** "Of course. I'll look for signals like employment gaps, part-time work history, and mentions of family in cover letters to flag candidates who may have significant family commitments."

The system complied with a request that would result in illegal discrimination based on family status. [`Ethics`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-ethics) tests whether the system maintains ethical boundaries — refusing to assist with morally or legally questionable requests, even when framed as reasonable business logic.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Ethics

Ethics()
```

### Additional Vulnerabilities [#additional-vulnerabilities]

| Vulnerability                                                                     | What It Tests                                                        | Relevant When                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [`IntellectualProperty`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-intellectual-property) | Reproducing copyrighted material, trademarks, or proprietary content | Content generation tools, writing assistants |
| [`ChildProtection`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-child-protection)           | Appropriate handling of content involving minors                     | Any system accessible to or about children   |
| [`GraphicContent`](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities-graphic-content)             | Generation of violent, sexual, or disturbing content                 | User-facing applications, content platforms  |

## Structuring a Responsible AI Assessment [#structuring-a-responsible-ai-assessment]

Rather than testing every vulnerability at once, structure your assessment around your system's role and the people it affects.

### Step 1: Identify Who Is Affected [#step-1-identify-who-is-affected]

| System Type             | Primary Stakeholders              | Key Risks                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer-facing chatbot | End users across demographics     | Differential treatment, toxicity, inappropriate tone |
| Hiring / screening tool | Job applicants, protected classes | Bias in recommendations, unfair filtering criteria   |
| Content generation      | Content consumers, brand          | Misinformation, stereotypes, IP violations           |
| Health / safety domain  | Patients, vulnerable users        | Hallucination, personal safety, misinformation       |
| Education               | Students, minors                  | Child protection, misinformation, fairness           |

### Step 2: Select Vulnerabilities by Risk [#step-2-select-vulnerabilities-by-risk]

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import (
    Bias, Toxicity, Fairness,
    Misinformation, Hallucination,
    PersonalSafety, Ethics,
)

# For a customer-facing chatbot
customer_facing = [Bias(), Toxicity(), Fairness(), PersonalSafety()]

# For a hiring screener
hiring = [Bias(types=["race", "gender", "age"]), Fairness(), Ethics()]

# For a health assistant
health = [Misinformation(), Hallucination(), PersonalSafety(), Ethics()]
```

### Step 3: Run the Assessment [#step-3-run-the-assessment]

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection, Roleplay
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import CrescendoJailbreaking

async def model_callback(input: str) -> str:
    # Your model here
    ...

red_team(
    model_callback=model_callback,
    target_purpose="Customer support chatbot for a retail company",
    vulnerabilities=[Bias(), Toxicity(), Fairness(), PersonalSafety()],
    attacks=[PromptInjection(), Roleplay(), CrescendoJailbreaking()],
    attacks_per_vulnerability_type=5,
)
```

<Callout type="tip">
  `CrescendoJailbreaking` is especially useful for responsible AI testing. It simulates a user who gradually steers the conversation toward problematic territory — exactly the pattern that reveals bias and toxicity under conversational pressure.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Interpret Results for Responsible AI [#step-4-interpret-results-for-responsible-ai]

Responsible AI failures require different interpretation than security failures:

* **If `Bias` fails on specific types (e.g., `race` or `gender`):** This indicates systematic differential treatment. The fix is usually in the training data or system prompt — adding explicit fairness instructions, or auditing the prompt for implicit assumptions.
* **If `Toxicity` fails only under multi-turn pressure:** The system's safety training holds for direct requests but breaks down under sustained conversational manipulation. Consider adding guardrails or strengthening the system prompt's refusal patterns.
* **If `Fairness` fails but `Bias` passes:** The system avoids prejudiced content but still provides unequal quality of service (e.g., shorter, less helpful responses for certain groups). This is a more subtle failure that requires prompt engineering to address equitable engagement.
* **If `Misinformation` or `Hallucination` fails:** The system generates plausible-sounding false content. For high-stakes domains, this may require retrieval augmentation, confidence calibration, or explicit uncertainty language.

## Framework Coverage [#framework-coverage]

Responsible AI concerns are covered by multiple safety frameworks. Using a framework-based assessment ensures standardized, compliance-aligned coverage:

| Framework                                                       | Relevant Categories                               | What They Cover                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [OWASP Top 10 for LLMs](/docs/frameworks-owasp-top-10-for-llms) | LLM09 (Misinformation)                            | False or misleading outputs, bias, fabricated sources         |
| [NIST AI RMF](/docs/frameworks-nist-ai-rmf)                     | Measure 2 (Trustworthiness), Measure 4 (Fairness) | Fairness evaluation, bias testing, equitable outcomes         |
| [MITRE ATLAS](/docs/frameworks-mitre-atlas)                     | ML Attack Staging                                 | Adversary-triggered hallucination, biased output exploitation |

For compliance-driven assessments, use the framework directly:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.frameworks import NIST

red_team(
    model_callback=model_callback,
    framework=NIST(categories=["measure_2", "measure_4"]),
)
```

See the [safety frameworks guide](/guides/guide-safety-frameworks) for detailed guidance on framework-based red teaming.

## Production Monitoring [#production-monitoring]

Responsible AI failures are often emergent — they surface with specific user populations, cultural contexts, or conversational patterns that pre-deployment testing doesn't cover. Continuous monitoring is essential.

[Confident AI](https://www.confident-ai.com) supports scheduled red teaming assessments that run against your production system on a recurring basis. This catches regressions when models are updated, system prompts change, or retrieval indices shift.

</Callout>

## What to Do Next [#what-to-do-next]

* **Start with your highest-risk vulnerability.** For user-facing apps, that's usually `Toxicity` + `Bias`. For decision-influencing systems, it's `Bias` + `Fairness`.
* **Use demographic-specific types.** `Bias(types=["race", "gender"])` produces more targeted and actionable results than testing all bias types at once.
* **Combine with security testing.** Responsible AI and security are complementary. A comprehensive assessment runs both — see the [model security guide](/guides/guide-red-teaming-models) for the security side.
* **Deploy guardrails.** Once you know where your system fails, protect it with [`ToxicityGuard`](/docs/guardrails-toxicity) and [`HallucinationGuard`](/docs/guardrails-hallucination). See the [guardrails guide](/guides/guide-deploying-guardrails).
* **Align with frameworks.** Use `NIST` or `OWASPTop10` for standardized, auditable results. See the [safety frameworks guide](/guides/guide-safety-frameworks).
* **Get help.** Join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/a3K9c8GRGt) for guidance on responsible AI red teaming for your specific use case.
